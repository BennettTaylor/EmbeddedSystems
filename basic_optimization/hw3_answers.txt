qsort_large spends 81.75% of its time executing the function compare based on the flat profile (average over 5 samples).
qsort_large spends 18.38% of its time executing the function frame_dummy based on the flat profile (average over 5 samples).
qsort_large spends 0.81% of its time executing the function main based on the flat profile (average over 5 samples).

myOptimization1: My best optimization method was using a subtraction of squared distance instead of a comparison of distances. The results were the same because comparing distances and square distances always gives the same result and the compare function needs a -, 0, or + result which the subtraction provides in the same way as the comparison.
myOptimization2: My second best optimization method was adding the -O3 optimization flag to the makefile for enabling compiler optimizations.
Difference btw grid and embedded: Eng grid resulted in faster performace, likely because the chips that ran the code on eng grid likely more powerful, drew more power, and had a higher clock rate. This is because bbb is an arm based chip used in embedded systems rather than a dedicated desktop chip.
